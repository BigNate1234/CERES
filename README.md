# CERES
Univ. of Miami Senior Design project prototype scripts

# Overview
This repository contains code that, with proper calibration
and integration, can funtion to control all sub-systems
in the X-Hab: CERES project commissioned for the University
of Miami senior design project. This code is expected to
run on the RPi 4 platform with testing between the RPi 4
platform and the RPi Zero W+ platform.

# Notice
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, proper integration and
calibration was not possible for a fully realized prototype
for the overall system. However, the code is commented for
easy modification of parameters used to further develop
this project.
